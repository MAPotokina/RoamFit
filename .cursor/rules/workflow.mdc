# Development Workflow

> **Reference**: Follow [vision.md](../vision.md) for technical architecture and [conventions.md](../conventions.md) for code standards.

## Workflow Rules

1. **Follow the plan strictly** - Work through [tasklist.md](./tasklist.md) iterations sequentially
2. **One iteration at a time** - Complete each iteration fully before moving to the next
3. **Get approval before implementation** - Propose solution with code snippets, wait for approval
4. **Test after implementation** - Verify iteration test criteria before marking complete
5. **Update progress** - Mark tasks and update progress table after completion
6. **Commit after each iteration** - Commit changes with clear message

## Step-by-Step Process

### Before Starting an Iteration

1. Read the iteration goal and tasks in [tasklist.md](./tasklist.md)
2. Review relevant sections in [vision.md](../vision.md) and [conventions.md](../conventions.md)
3. **Propose solution** with:
   - Code snippets showing approach
   - File structure changes
   - Key implementation details
4. **Wait for approval** before implementing

### During Implementation

1. Implement approved solution
2. Follow code conventions from [conventions.md](../conventions.md)
3. Keep it simple (KISS principle)
4. Write minimal code that works

### After Implementation

1. **Run the test** specified in the iteration
2. **Verify functionality** works as expected
3. **Wait for confirmation** from user
4. **Update tasklist.md**:
   - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
   - Update progress table status (⏳ → 🚧 → ✅)
   - Update test status
5. **Commit to repository**:
   - Clear commit message: `feat: Complete iteration X - [description]`
   - Include relevant files only

### Moving to Next Iteration

1. **Agree on next iteration** with user
2. **Repeat process** from "Before Starting an Iteration"

## Important Notes

- **No skipping iterations** - Each builds on the previous
- **No over-engineering** - MVP first, simplest solution
- **Test before marking complete** - Verify iteration test criteria
- **Ask questions** if requirements are unclear
- **Reference vision.md** for architecture decisions

## Commit Message Format

```
feat: Complete iteration X - [Brief description]

- [List key changes]
- [Any important notes]
```

Example:
```
feat: Complete iteration 3 - LLM utilities with logging

- Added call_llm() and call_vision() wrapper functions
- Implemented logging to logs/llm_calls.log
- Added error handling with single retry
```
